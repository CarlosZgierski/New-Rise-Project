# New-Rise-Project
Project done in a semester for College, my first big Unity Project.
This project has been long abandoned, since it's a College project done for the semester at the time.
This project has been programmed by Me (Carlos Alberto Zgierski da Silveira) and Lucas Krus, a College coleague. I worked on it as Lead Developer and Lead Designer. I programmed all the mechanics in the game, from the AI to the Side Scroll.
